Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification
Rock-Paper-Scissors

Overview
This project employs deep learning techniques to classify images of rock, paper, and scissors using Keras, a high-level neural networks API. The trained model can accurately predict the hand gesture depicted in a given image.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilized a comprehensive dataset containing images of rock, paper, and scissors gestures.
Model Architecture: Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras for image classification.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deployment: Explore possibilities of deploying the model for real-time predictions.
Usage
Training: Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model on your dataset.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict hand gestures in new images.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Keras
TensorFlow
Matplotlib, NumPy, etc.
